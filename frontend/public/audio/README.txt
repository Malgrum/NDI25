Place your audio files here so the app can play them:

- Main_theme.mp3  -> main theme that should play when arriving on the site (no loop)
- lose.mp3        -> played once when the player loses (lowers main theme volume)

Example path in the app: `/audio/Main_theme.mp3` and `/audio/lose.mp3`.

Browsers may block autoplay until the user interacts with the page. If you experience no sound on load,
click once anywhere (or press a button) to allow playback.
